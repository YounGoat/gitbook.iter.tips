和纵横江湖多年不倒的老牌程序打交道，如果你是认真的，那么官网的话、帮助文档的话，都要认真读、仔细读、反复读。读通！读懂！读透！

[MinGW 官方网站](http://www.mingw.org/)是这样描述的：

>	MinGW, a contraction of "Minimalist GNU for Windows", is a minimalist development environment for native Microsoft Windows applications.

>	MinGW provides a complete Open Source programming tool set which is suitable for the development of native MS-Windows applications, and which do not depend on any 3rd-party C-Runtime DLLs. (It does depend on a number of DLLs provided by Microsoft themselves, as components of the operating system; most notable among these is MSVCRT.DLL, the Microsoft C runtime library. Additionally, threaded applications must ship with a freely distributable thread support DLL, provided as part of MinGW itself).

>	MinGW compilers provide access to the functionality of the Microsoft C runtime and some language-specific runtimes. MinGW, being Minimalist, does not, and never will, attempt to provide a POSIX runtime environment for POSIX application deployment on MS-Windows. If you want POSIX application deployment on this platform, please consider Cygwin instead.

>	Primarily intended for use by developers working on the native MS-Windows platform, but also available for cross-hosted use, (see note below -- you may need to follow the "read more" link to see it), MinGW includes:

>	*	A port of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), including C, C++, ADA and Fortran compilers;
>	*	GNU Binutils for Windows (assembler, linker, archive manager)
>	*	A command-line installer, with optional GUI front-end, (mingw-get) for MinGW and MSYS deployment on MS-Windows
>	*	A GUI first-time setup tool (mingw-get-setup), to get you up and running with mingw-get.
>

>	MSYS, a contraction of "Minimal SYStem", is a Bourne Shell command line interpreter system. Offered as an alternative to Microsoft's cmd.exe, this provides a general purpose command line environment, which is particularly suited to use with MinGW, for porting of many Open Source applications to the MS-Windows platform; a light-weight fork of Cygwin-1.3, it includes a small selection of Unix tools, chosen to facilitate that objective.

我实在没有办法割舍一字一句，只能全盘照抄。
